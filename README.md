# CS6476-CV-Python
Repository of python code translated from the matlab code provided in the course lectures.

## Contributions
To contribute, code should be named after the lecture that it appears in. Images should be placed in the images directory.

If you wish to add to this repo, open an issue that reflects the lecture you intend to cover. For example, if you wish to make examples of 
the `2A-L2 Filters` lecture, you would create a ticket that would say you are working on this. This is mainly to avoid people working on the 
same lectures and thus wasting time.

If adding a new lecture, be sure to place it's files into a new sub-directory with that lecture as it's name. Following our example above, 
we would add a `2A-L2-Filters` directory under `Code/`. By ensuring all of the lectures are in their own little modules,
it makes very easy to find/maintain our code.  

## OSI Note
Please note that the only code that should be contributed to this repository is code translated from the lectures. DO NOT contribute any code from the Problem Sets.
