# CS6476-CV-Python
Repository of python code translated from the matlab code provided in the course lectures.

## Contributions
To contribute, code should be named after the lecture that it appears in. Images should be placed in the images directory.

If you wish to add to this repo, open an issue that reflects the lecture you intend to cover. For example, if you wish 
to make examples of the `2A-L2 Filters` lecture, you would create a ticket that would say you are working on this. This
is mainly to avoid people working on the same lectures and thus wasting time.

If adding a new lecture, be sure to place its files into a new subdirectory with that lecture as its name. Following our
example above, we would add a `2A-L2-Filters` directory under `Code/`. By default, the contents within the results
folder will be ignored to avoid clutter but will make it easier for users to find their resulting images. View
`2A-L3-Linearity and convolution` for an example. By ensuring all the lectures are in their own little modules, it makes
very easy to find/maintain our code.

## OSI Note
Please note that the only code that should be contributed to this repository is code translated from the lectures. 
DO NOT contribute any code from the Problem Sets.
