# What we need help with 

* Adding translated code from the lectures
* Organizing the code into a maintainable structure
* Ensuring the code matches the lectures (use best judgement here as we establish a more precise rule)
* Adding CI processes to confirm correct and working code is being pushed. 


# To Contribute

## Adding code that is not present in the repo
Create a new file in `code/` that uses Upper_Snake_Case, prefaced by the lecture video number. For example, `1.Introduction.py`, or `69.Numpy_Is_Nice.py`. 

Code should be formatted using the default rules of `black` and linted using `ruff`. (TODO set up black/ruff for formatting/linting). 

Most code should be procedural. However, if code does have to be broken out into function, please use type hinting. It's 2025. 

## Modifying code that is already present 
If you find an error in the code, or think there is a better way to display the concept from the lecture video, file a pull request and write a short blurb as to why you think it should be fixed.
